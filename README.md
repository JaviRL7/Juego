How to Run the Game
This project was developed using Pygame Zero.

To run the game, make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then install Pygame Zero. On Linux, you can do this with the command: sudo apt install python3-pgzero.

Once installed, go to the project folder and run the game with: pgzrun main.py.

If you're using a virtual environment, activate it and install Pygame Zero inside it using: pip install pgzero. You can then run the game with: python main.py.

Note: The game should be launched from the folder where main.py is located.

About the Music
Since I work in a Linux environment, audio playback—especially for MP3 files—can be inconsistent without additional codecs.
Due to the limited time available for this project, I chose to focus on refining the game mechanics and code structure rather than troubleshooting audio compatibility issues across systems.

Thank You
Thank you for the opportunity to take part in this process.
It was a pleasure to create this small game, and I hope it reflects both my attention to detail and my enthusiasm for joining your team.

I look forward to hearing from you.
